# Custom Video Speed For YouTube (App)

This is the repository for the Custom Video Speed for YouTube app for macOS and iOS. 

Just like the Chrome and Firefox version this is a web extension. Unlike the Chrome and Firefox version, Apple requires all Safari extensions to be a 
part of apps and come from the App Store. This repository only contains the Swift code that Apple requires to run the App part of a Safari Extension.
The actual extension code can be found [here](https://github.com/elunico/custom-youtube-speed) in the original respository under `firefox`. The Safari version of this extension was created using
a tool from Apple to convert a WebExtensions extension to an App Extension and the code used to do this was the Firefox code for the original 
Custom Video Speed for YouTube extension. 

You can find the Apps [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/custom-video-speed-for-youtube/id6443640011)
